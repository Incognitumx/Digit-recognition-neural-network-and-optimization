# Digit-recognition-neural-network-and-optimization
Using CNN to improve digit recognition accuracy.
---
This project aims to explore the effect that different models of Neural network (from fully connected neural network to convolutional nerual network) brought to recognise and classify hand-written digits of MNIST set. It documents the process of optimizing the structure of model and adjusting the training algorithm to increase the accuracy of digit recognition and classification.

### Project Objectives:
i. Achieving digit recognition and classification based on MNIST set
</br>
ii. Exploring the effect that different models bring to the accuracy of the result
</br>
iii. Increase the accuracy by using convolutional neural network to 99% (expected)

### Performance Comparison:
